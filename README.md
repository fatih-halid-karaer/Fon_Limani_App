# FON LIMANI APP
A Flutter project.
You need to install an emulator and then import this project in an area such as Android studio.  However, on some pages, the URL of the project owner is written as the URL.  For this reason, you should change this variable on some pages with your own Internet connection. Apart from that, make sure that Flutter is installed in the studio you use and that you open it as a flutter project.
Additionally, in the project, some pages such as portfolio_page.dart were previously designated for different purposes, but are now used for different purposes such as news and reports. Page codes are in the lib.
